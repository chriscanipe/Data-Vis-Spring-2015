###Week 6 Notes and Assignment

If you haven't already, please send a project proposal to myself and Mike Jenner. Your proposal should identify a dataset and describe how you'd like to visualize it.

**This weekâ€™s assignment (DUE SATURDAY 2/28 AT NOON)**

**Describe and sketch your final project.** By this point, you should have identified a dataset and project idea and received feedback from Mike and or myself. This is your opportunity to refine your proposal.

Your **written description** should answer three questions:

1. What is the dataset you'd like to visualize?

2. What story does it tell?

3. How will your chart convey that story to readers?

The decription should **include a link** to a chart similar to the one you're proposing. This will most likely serve as the starting point for you project.

Two great places to look:

**The Sketch**

You can sketch the chart however you'd like. If you're ore comfortable using Photoshop or Illustrator, you're free to use those tools. If you'd like to sketch it with pencil on a sheet of paper, that works too.

The sketch should indicate which data points you plan to chart. For example, the line chart we went over in class plotted Columbia's unemployment rate for every month since 2004. Time was on the x-axis, and the unemployment rate was on the y-axis. If you're using tooltips to allow users to interact with and explore the data, your sketch should reflect that as well.
