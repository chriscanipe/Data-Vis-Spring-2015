###Week 7 Notes and instruction for Final Projects

Projects are due **MONDAY AT NOON**. Your job is to get it working to the best of your ability.

I'd also like an update from everyone by **noon Saturday**. This will help me understand where each of you are at in the process and whether you've run into any major roadblocks.

If you do get stuck, make use of the resources we've discussed in class:
* Google (usually the best place to start)
* [The D3 documentation](http://d3js.org/)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/)
* And of course, the examples we've built in class.

And again, feel free to reach out. I'll be in Atlanta for a conference all week, but I'll try to get back to you as quickly as possible.

Good luck!
Chris
